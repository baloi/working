    Busy filling up my application for the second job in Thera Dynamics. Seems
    like a very good opportunity for me. Coding soon though. I borrowed Henry
    Kissinger's book "World Order" from the library. A good read.

    A day of just enough activity during the day. Reading "Move Your DNA" and
    accepting that exercising is not the really the end-all. More activity 
    during the day. More movements. Varied movements. Lift, crouch, jump, walk,
    run, bend, twist, squat, pull, push. You have six hundred muscles in your
    body and there is a good chance that your exercise program does not use ALL
    of them.

    Set up the practice/working directory for my C programming studies. The 
    actual "working" directory is in my BSD machine. Just uploaded to github and
    now adding this README file.

    Move every 30 minutes!!
